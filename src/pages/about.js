            I'm a software engineer who writes.

            Welcome to an HTML document in the global system of interconnected
            computer networks that use the TCP/IP protocol to communicate
            between networks and devices.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although I have always been into computers, I never imagined being
            an engineer writing code. In fact, I have an LLM degree in the field
            of tax law. I was supposed to become a tax lawyer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet, something pulled me into the creative areas of life, such as
            writing and photography.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was in one late evening in a small but cozy room in Taipei where
            I discovered the field of front-end development. I knew instantly
            that I've found what I've been looking for and began learning HTML
            the very next day. The rest is history.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today I work on personal projects using tools and languages such as{" "}
            <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong> and GraphQL.
          </p>

          <p>
            I enjoy coding up beautiful user interfaces that provide the best
            possible experience for the user. Through code, I can express myself
            artistically while satisfying my curiosity for technology.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you want to tell me something, feel free to email me. I'd be
            happy to hear about your ideas.
          </p>

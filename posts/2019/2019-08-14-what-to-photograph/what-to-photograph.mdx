Here’s a thought: it’s not about what you photograph, it’s about how you photograph.

We put so much emphasis on what is “worthy” to shoot and what’s not. We often make a huge deal about taking pictures as if we would have something to lose if we take too many photos or photos of “unworthy” things.

Or perhaps, it’s that we want to not look weird by taking photos of random things.

But we should photograph everything that even slightly draws our attention. Why? Why not!

There’s nothing to lose and so much to gain.

When I take pictures of random things, I don’t worry about if any of them is going to be decent enough – I don’t care.

I photograph them because they look interesting and because it’s a practice. It’s an exercise to practice my composition – and e.g., mannequins are perfect for that although you can also very well practice composition on trees, street signs, buildings – virtually on anything basically.

So be creative, walk around in your room or office and take pictures of the mundane “boring” things and try to make aesthetically good photographs. Simplify the scene, create ambiguity. It’s all just a practice. Do it for fun without any outcome in mind.

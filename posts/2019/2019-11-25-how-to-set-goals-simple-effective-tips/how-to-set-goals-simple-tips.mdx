First, as Ray Dalio wrote in his “Principles”, you can have just about anything you want, but not everything you want.” So, I recommend writing down everything you want to achieve, then take the three most important ones, and forget everything else (at least for the time being).

Second, be really clear and precise about what you want. Don’t be vague like “I want to become successful.” Who doesn’t?

Third, write down clear (again!) actionable steps that get you there. What are the steps you need to take that you know if you’d do them, you’d get to your goal? It’s best to break down big steps into smaller chunks that make sense. If your goal is to climb Mount Everest, you wouldn’t write down the steps, as e.g., 1) get to the base of the mountain; 2) climb to the top. They’re way too abstract and massive.

Fourth, write down estimated timeframes for these steps, or at least for some of them.

Fifth, read Grant Cardone’s “The 10X Rule” and realize that you should set 10X higher goals than you normally would. Don’t hold yourself back! If you limit yourself, then it’s near-impossible to get 10X results as well.

The main reason is this: You'll be a lot more happier. You'll be able to actually enjoy photography because you don't have to carry a big clunky camera with you. Because it's portable, you can take it with you almost everywhere you go. This means you're much more likely to take pictures of spontaneous situations. Your camera is always ready. You make more pictures which means you get better quicker.

I remember when I had a DSLR. I tried to take it with me when I went out but because it was big and heavy I usually left it at home. Naturally some great photo opportunities came along.

Now, what good is it to have a fancy full frame camera sitting at home if you're unable to take pictures with it. You can have the best camera in the world but it's useless if it's not with you. Other times it was in my bag and it was a hassle to take it out and it took a lot of room there as well.

I'm currently rocking a small Fuji with an APSC sensor and it's truly an awesome camera. I probably took more pictures with it in first couple of weeks than I did with my DSLR in months. The image quality is amazing as well.

So, unless you're professional shooting sports or models in a studio, it really doesn't make any sense to have a big camera. Nowadays mirrorless cameras are the trend. They're supposedly smaller than DSLR's. A little. Attach a lens onto it and it's just as big as a DSLR with a lens. Doesn't make any difference in size at all.

If you're still not convinced, my camera has the same size sensor as most of the DSLR's. The famous Ricoh GR II which looks like a cheap soap box also has a APSC sensor. Just google it if you're not familiar with this one and be blown away. So, don't let the size fool you. Most of the reviews say this thing is an absolute beast. Besides, digital cameras nowadays are pretty much all the same. It's like smart phones. They all do the same things.

Speaking of phones, they are great as well. It's pretty amazing what you can do with some editing.

I still remember the time I went out to shoot just with my phone. I had one of the best times in my life exploring, walking around and taking pictures with my phone and then editing them later. I though that a DSLR will get me better pictures. It didn't. It made me enjoy photography less.

Get better not bitter

I regularly look at some of my own photographs and re-read my own articles. Not because to evaluate or edit them but because I think they're really good. Good for me.

We shouldn’t be ashamed of our art. Kids are not embarrassed about whatever they create. They're proud and they don't hide it. Why do we adults feel the need to downplay ourselves often?

This is why I also have great respect for photographers like Bruce Gilden and Eric Kim. They know their work is good, and they are not ashamed of it. They don’t explicitly brag about it, but they don’t put themselves down either. And why should they?

That doesn’t mean to become arrogant and oblivious. No, always be the student and never think you’re above it.

However, if you think you make good stuff, never put yourself down.

This applies to everything we do in life. Always be pumped up by your own actions, your own jokes, and stories. Always entertain yourself, don’t seek validation or entertainment from external sources.

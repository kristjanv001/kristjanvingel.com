One of the most powerful marketing tools available is the email list. There's a reason everyone uses it. It has stood the test of time, and it works.

Your email list is the follower's list you should be building instead.

You will own this list. It enables you to communicate with your followers directly, and you can take this list with you. It's platform-independent.

Even if your website gets taken down for some reason, you can still communicate with your people. You can keep them updated, share your thoughts, and tell them about your new products, exhibitions, events. It serves you a lifetime.

Most people don't change their email addresses very often, and there's a much bigger chance of them seeing your email.

Ryan Holiday, before he published his first book, started an email newsletter where he gave monthly book recommendations. By the time he was about to publish his book, the list had grown significantly. Do you think there were people who bought his new book because he told about it in his email newsletter?

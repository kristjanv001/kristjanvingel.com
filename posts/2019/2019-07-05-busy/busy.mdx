We live in a world of too much. There’s so much going on all the time and so much to do.

I remember, when I was a little kid, I was sometimes bored. Nowadays, we’re never bored. It’s almost impossible to feel bored.

Just turn on TV or music or of course check some social media sites for updates. That’s what we do when we get home from work. Immediately put on some stimulating thing. If it gets too quiet we freak out.

When was the last time you had just time with yourself? No phone, no music, nothing.

We fill up our days with so many meaningless tasks and then say we’re too busy. Busy doing what? Answering emails that could easily be left unanswered? Would life be so bad if you wouldn’t answer those immediately or all of them? No. You will not explode, and your life won’t fall apart because of some emails.

Is it rude? Maybe. I don’t care. All I know is that there’s only so much time we have and I don’t want to fill that up with doing these menial tasks. I want to do stuff that actually matters to me.

Email is just a random example that came first to my mind. There are many types of meaningless tasks we do day by day, taking most of our time.

We have this unrealistic expectation of being in control of everything. It’s okay not to have control. Let it go. Just do the important stuff. Stuff that matters.

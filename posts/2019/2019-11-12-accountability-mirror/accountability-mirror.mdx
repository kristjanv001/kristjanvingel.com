This is an awesome tool I got from David Goggins’ book “Can’t Hurt Me.” If you haven’t read it already, I highly highly recommend doing so.

I write down the next steps of my goals on sticky notes and stick them on a bathroom mirror. E.g., if you’re trying to lose weight, you might write down how many pounds or kilos you wish to lose next.

It’s important to be specific and use exact numbers and metrics that can be measured. Being vague like “get rich” or “become fit” hardly ever work, because these statements are not really even goals - they’re more like wishes and hopes.

Placing these tiny steps that you want to achieve on a bathroom mirror ensures that you see them every day - thus holding yourself accountable. You look yourself in the mirror every day and then look at your goals. You can't lie to yourself there.

If you achieve a goal, then remove the old sticky not and replace it with a new one. Simple yet effective.

Also, it’s important to break bigger goals into smaller steps as it’s easier to measure your results and stay motivated if you are continuously gaining small wins and moving forward.

I personally find this idea really cool and continue using it. Try it yourself!

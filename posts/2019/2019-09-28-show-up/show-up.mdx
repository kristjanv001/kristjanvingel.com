Show up no matter what. Show up every day, not because you need something from others but because you want to.

Many people want others to show up, but they themselves don’t even show up. So, how can you expect others to show up at your “party” if you don’t show up?

They want others to show up first, and so they can choose to show up or not.

This is not how it works.

We all know that trust doesn’t happen overnight; it takes time.  
Therefore, you must show up first, no matter what, every day, even if nobody else comes. And then _maybe_ - after a while - people see you showing up every day, and they start to trust you and show up as well.

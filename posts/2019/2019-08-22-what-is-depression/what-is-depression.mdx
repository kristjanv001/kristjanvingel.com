We tend associate negative emotions with something "bad" and positive emotions with "good."

However, a better way to look at it would be try to understand the reason behind the emotion.

A negative emotion is our brain just telling us that we might be heading in a wrong direction.

I don't think it's always the case, as we can't always be happy and content, but if we feel something similar to a depression, its a clear sign that we're doing something wrong and our brain is letting us know that that something needs immediate fixing.

So, instead of being depressed and trying to medicate the symptoms, in most cases its possible to fix it by tweaking our lifestyle.

It's so frightening how easily hard core medications get prescribed. They should be the last option, not the first.

I’ve been experimenting with binaural beats for a while now and come to the conclusion that they do work. In fact, it’s scientifically proven, so no need to argue about that - unless someone can prove otherwise, we can stick to the “they do work!” for the time being.

But experience is king, so I highly recommend testing out yourself. It’s never a good idea to blindly believe anything. Always try it out yourself.

As far as I understand, they work by stimulating certain parts of the brain, helping you to get more easily into the desired state of mind e.g., deep focus, relaxation, creativity, just to name a few.

As of writing this blog article, I’m listening to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZBruGZZo_o). Needless to say, I’m a huge fan of the Magnetic Minds channel and use many of their uploaded tracks while doing my work. So far, I think it’s one of the best channels out there.

There are even channels that try to mimic the effects of various drugs like cocaine, heroin, [Adderal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7MWV4TexGM), etc. Have fun with them as well.

If you’re trying to get work done, get some black coffee (no sugar, no milk), turn off your phone, put it out of your sight, and listen to focus inducing binaural beats instead of music and I’m certain you achieve the state of flow fast.

In this day and age, being able to do focused work without getting continuously distracted will already set you miles apart of most people who check their phones every 5 minutes (literally!) and are therefore never able to reach deeper levels of thinking.

I use everything I can to help me with focusing - and binaural beats have now a solid place in my “toolbox”. I hope they can help you as well.

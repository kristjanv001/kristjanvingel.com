We’ve all heard the saying that “the grass is always greener on the other side” - that it’s easier or better somewhere else. Usually, it’s just an illusion as new places bring a set of new challenges and problems that we might not see.

However, I’ve come to realize that if you’re not satisfied with where you are at the moment, then it’s best to move. It may just turn out that the grass actually is greener somewhere else.

Of course, there is no perfect place, but that doesn’t mean we should shut up and just accept where we are without trying to find something better for our needs.

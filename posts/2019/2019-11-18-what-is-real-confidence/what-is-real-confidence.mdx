Confidence is not about knowing that you will succeed. It’s the knowing that no matter what happens, you’ll be just fine.

However, in order to get there, one has to try and fail a lot. The goal is basically to become comfortable at failing. So comfortable that if you fail, you’re not de-railed or that you become reactive.

When something doesn’t go the way you wish, you feel like at home. You’ve been there so many times that you know every corner of this place.

Interestingly, this is when you also start to experience success. Simply because you’re grown confident, which allows you to remain grounded and focused in a situation - all essential ingredients for success.

Many successful people have confirmed that if you don’t fail, you don’t learn. “Success is just a bunch of failures,” said one guy who managed to crawl out of drug addiction, learn a new skill from scratch, establish different companies related to this skill, and make millions along the way.

If we want to become more confident, we have to fail more. Of course, it doesn’t mean to fail on purpose, but rather to be okay with not succeeding for a long time and keep trying.

Besides, you only truly fail if you give up. Otherwise, it’s just work in progress.

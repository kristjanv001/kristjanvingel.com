If you haven’t already, go to a bookstore or Amazon and get that book. It’s one of the best books I’ve ever read. I haven’t even finished it - in fact, I’m barely half-way through, and it has already shed so much light. I’m blown away.

Somewhat funny that just a day ago, I posted my top 10 books but did not include it in there. It’s because I hadn’t read it when I wrote that article. The very same day, I started to read it, and now, here I am writing this. In fact, I would definitely put it on my list if I’d write yesterday’s article today.

This book, along with Viktor E. Frankl’s “Man’s Search for Meaning” and Tim S. Grover’s “Relentless” shines so much light on our petty little problems and the society’s softness. A true eye-opener.

I agree with Goggins. Most people are really soft. We’re grown so soft that we give up as soon as a little obstacle comes on our way. Or worse - we adopt the victim mentality blaming everyone and everything except ourselves. And by no means am I excluding myself.

The sad thing is that we’re only operating around 40% of our potential. We could do so much more if we’d just wouldn’t be mentally so weak.

This is the book that will shove you straight so deep inside your own head that you’ll feel stupid about complaining about the “issues” of your life. It takes away all your excuses and makes your “problems” look like a child’s whining.

There's no chance you'll look at life the same way after going through the book (only applies to people who want to get better; it has no effect on people in denial).

What’s great about this book is that it has challenges. These challenges will make you face your inner demons and own who you are. As Goggins has pointed out - we keep optimizing ourselves and making us feel better on the outside, yet absolutely neglecting the inside. We keep running away from ourselves.

To get a taste of the book, check out his Impact Theory interviews with Tom Bilyeu [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78I9dTB9vqM) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIM7E8e9JKY). Just listening to the intro by Bilyeu itself will blow you away.

I recommend getting the audiobook, as it has extra commentary, and Goggins talks a lot about the “behind the scenes” that are not included in the physical book.

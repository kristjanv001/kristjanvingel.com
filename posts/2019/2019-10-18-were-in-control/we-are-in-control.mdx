We have so much more control over our lives than we think we have.

Understanding this is, in essence, the difference of seeing possibilities vs. only seeing obstacles.

E.g., many people blame their unfortunate life on circumstances such as a rough childhood, poverty, government, or any other thing.

But so what? There are so many others who have had even worse situations, yet they crawled out of the gutter and became successful. There really are no excuses.

If someone else in a similar situation has gotten the success you want and dream of, then you can have it too. We're all cut from the same cloth. If one man can do it, another one can as well.

We all have that thing we want to do, but we’re not doing them. I’m not talking about some to-do list. I’m talking about the big things. Dreams!

“I’ll do it someday,” we tell ourselves. We keep putting it off over and over again. It’s like we’re in some daze not even awake when we have this mindset of “someday.”

That “someday” is never going to come if you don’t take action now.

I used to do this a lot. I told myself that I have plenty of time until I realized that there is no time. I’m not going to live forever.

This is the difference between highly successful people and unsuccessful people. They have a sense of urgency. There is no time to watch TV or do any of that meaningless crap.

And believe me, I was one of the biggest derper ever. I could play video games all day long. I have probably wasted at least a good decade of my life doing pretty much nothing spectacular. Even though I had all these goals and dreams, I told myself that I’d get to these things someday.

If you can relate to this, I have to tell you to wake up. Look around you. Start being at the cause of your life, not at the effect. Most people (I was definitely there) are run by the ego, biological drives, and social conditioning.

By ego, I mean e.g., buying stuff, luxury items to be cool and get more status. Worrying about things such as buying a new car and what other people are thinking.

Biological drives, like being hungry, sleepy, bored, horny, and simply reacting to these impulses run us as well. We are blessed with a wonderful part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex, which allows us to do the things we need to do, instead of what we feel like doing.

Social condition is huge too. How much of your thoughts are your own and how much are the society’s ideas and thoughts that you’ve simply inherited? Society tells us we need to go to university, get a good job, marry and all that.

There’s nothing wrong with each of these things. The point is, are you doing the things you want to do, or are you simply doing them, because you think it’s the right thing you’re supposed to do?

E.g., recently I heard this story of a girl who wanted to set up a small shop but was studying law because her parents wanted her to become a lawyer. So she became a lawyer. What a waste!

_The Matrix_ sounds really cliché, but it’s the perfect example. In contrast _Into the Wild_ shows us that you can do whatever you want to do. You can literally pack your stuff and travel almost anywhere in the world and do what you want to — highly inspiring movie. I recommend you to watch it.

It’s actually crazy how much we can do if we’d realize it. And realize that we’re not going to live forever.

You’re going to die soon. If you’re 30, you’ll be 35 in just a couple of years. Then 40 and 50 and the older you get, the harder it gets. The energy and drive becomes weaker. It’s a lot easier to start when you’re 20 than when you’re 30.

We talk about time passing quickly yet we live our lives in a way as if we’re going to live forever. I used to think that I live forever, as well. I played video games, watched stupid videos on the internet and all that.

In the meantime, time is ticking. Is this what you really want to spend your precious time on? Looking at memes? Watching other people live their lives?

Whatever you want to do, start now. Create a sense of urgency because urgent it is!

Momentum is one of the best things in life. It’s valuable, and if you don’t appreciate it enough, it will go away. Just like almost everything else in life. We want something so bad, and once we get it, we lose interest, or we don’t value it enough anymore.

We see it as a negative trait. We say things like: “he didn’t appreciate her enough, so he deserves it!”. When someone doesn’t appreciate someone or something enough, we look down on that person.

But we all do it. It’s built into us. We all do it, and then we all judge each other for it — typical humans. We’re very hypocritical animals. We do all the same things and judge others for doing those exact things.

Momentum is one of those things. It’s an abstract concept that not many people are aware of. It’s a little bit like a superpower that makes life a lot easier. That’s if you have it. If you don’t, then you need to do hard work to get it back again.

Momentum can be best described as inertia. Once you start doing something regularly, it becomes easier to do it every day. The more you do it, the stronger the momentum gets.

Let’s bring art as an example. In order to get good at our art, we should do it every day. If we do it every day, we get better and better. If we would only do our art e.g., once a week we’d die before we get to mastery.

Momentum that works as inertia can help us in this regard. But we have to work a bit to get it. We should do our thing at least a month or more to get proper momentum.

However, disrespect momentum - skip a few days - and momentum is gone. You didn’t respect it enough, so it left. Now you have to use a lot more energy and willpower and self-discipline to regain your momentum.

Believe it or not, but we judge each other for losing momentum as well.

If someone is trying to lose weight and wants to stick to a diet, momentum plays a crucial role. When that person loses momentum, we judge. Maybe not out loud, but in our mind, we judge.

We can’t control the judging part, but we can control whether we keep our momentum or not.

My advice to you is this: if you have momentum, keep it as if your life counts on it. You don’t skip a day (disrespect momentum)!

You will know when you have momentum in something. You would like to let loose, thinking that you’ve got it handled. You don’t. Trust me; you don’t.

Most of us ’don’t, and we don’t appreciate it until it’s gone.

Doing something, let’s say a couple of weeks straight and then not doing it for a couple of weeks is called “dabbling.” Dabbling around will never make you good at anything. It can make you mediocre, but if you want to get really good, then forget about dabbling.

Most people only dabble.

We should decide whether or not we want to make it (in our work or art) and if the answer is yes, then we should take it seriously and push ourselves to do it every day. Momentum will help us go through.

Some things just need to be done. We don't want to because that particular way might be uncomfortable but we know it's the only way.

We might say "tomorrow I start" or "someday" and procrastinate by avoiding the really important thing we need to do.

Maybe our mind is coming up with an excuse that there's some easier alternative so that we wouldn't need to do the work.

There is no alternative. If there would be, then we would have found it already.

So ask yourself: what's the alternative?

For the past few years, I wasn’t really sure where am I going with my life. I didn’t know what do I want and what am I even doing. That changed when I went to live in Taiwan.

After a month of being there, everything started to become clear. Not in an instant, but day-by-day, the fog cleared.

I took out my notebook and wrote down the things that I want out of my life. I wrote down my end goals and broke them down into three main parts or phases. For the first time in (probably) years, I knew who I am, what I want, where I’m going, and how to get there. I got to work immediately.

“Brool Story Co. Why should I care?” you may ask.

Here’s why.

We might not be even aware that we’re simply drifting through life in autopilot mode. That’s most people.

I’ve even asked some people about their dreams and surprisingly often heard “I don’t know” and also “I don’t have any dreams.” Needless to say, lacking a sense of purpose in life is the root of all kinds of psychological issues (my opinion).

I think the problem is that we’re not asking these questions from ourselves. Or only think about them once a year - e.g., at the start of a new year. However, successful people do this self-introspection all the time. E.g., Grant Cardone says he writes down his goals every single day - 2 times! Once in the morning and once in the evening.

Writing down or at least looking at your goals every once in a while reminds you to stay in track (or change to a completely different lane altogether). However, not paying attention to or not caring where you’re going is like a ship without a rudder. It’s going to hit the rocks.

So, take out a notepad (you should have a notebook or a journal) and do some introspection. Write down your goals (multiply by 10) and a clear action plan with estimated dates. I recommend breaking your goal(s) down to three — our brains like this number.

Ask questions like: “What kind of a person am I”; “What is my goal?”; “What do I want to do with my life?”; “Where am I going to be in 5 years if I keep going like this?” and so on. In other words, seek clarity!

Also, it is a good idea to get a journal. It helps to monitor your thoughts better. Besides, it’s so much fun to look back on what were you doing and thinking e.g., a year ago from now.

Get a journal! Seek clarity!

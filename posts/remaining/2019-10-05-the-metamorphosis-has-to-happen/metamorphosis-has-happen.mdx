There are some things in life that you not only want to have or achieve - you absolutely must achieve them. There’s just no other alternative.

This is how you will get what you want. To paraphrase Tony Robbins: You have to turn your “wants” and “shoulds” into “musts”. Instead of telling yourself: “I want this” you have to say: “I must have/become this”.

Chances are, everyone else also wants the things you want. It’s easy to want something. It takes zero energy to want something. However, by saying, “I must,” you’ll leave no other option.

If the pain of staying where you are becomes bigger than the pain of going through the necessary change, you’ll create leverage that forces you to go through that change.

Some things just have to happen - they might not be comfortable, but they have to happen. E.g., if a baby is born, she’s screaming, and it’s not comfortable - but it has to happen.

Or a caterpillar that turns into a butterfly - it’s not something comfortable and nice and smooth - it’s rough and messy. But change is rough and messy.

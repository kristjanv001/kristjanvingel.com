The answer is: you can’t.

The almighty Universe doesn’t work like that. If you want to take something, then you have to give back.

If you take but don’t intend to give back, then consider being in dept. It’s as if you use a credit card - at one point, you need to pay back the loan.

So, what am I even talking about here?

Some people think there’s a magic pill that will solve their challenges without them having to put in the work.

It’s as if the thought process goes something along the lines of: “What’s simple the trick to not put in the effort and somehow be entitled to all the great success in the world?”

There are countless videos and articles that give the impression that you can learn something difficult in just a few hours - or that you can get in shape in just a few days. Obviously, these claims are 99% times total BS.

Many of these titles are worded simply for baiting clicks. I admit, I sometimes use clickbait titles on my articles as well - why wouldn’t anyone want to use a clickbait title? After all, if these increase the chances of people seeing the content, why not.

Even many successful books have clickbaity titles - e.g., “The 7 habits of Highly Effective People”. Yet, not many people know that Covey drew heavily from Adlerian psychology to write the chapters of his book. Needless to say, the content of this book is very strong even though the title may make some people think it’s just some self-help garbage.

The problem arises when the actual content promises you to quickly solve problems - making you believe there’s a quick fix.

Everything has to be earned. Dues have to be paid.

How often have you seen people on social write about what they’re going to do? Many call themselves freelancers or CEO’s and talk so much about what they are going to achieve. Whereas, in reality, there's no substance to their claim whatsoever.

Why do we like to do that?

Ego gratification.

When you talk and explain what you’re going to do, it feels as if you’re already done it, or at least moved a bit closer. The truth is, of course, that nothing has changed.

I’ve found out that its much better to shut up about what you’re going to do, and just do it instead. Or not do it.

E.g., I’ve had thoughts about telling about my plans only to later realize that it’s not what I want to pursue. Good thing, I kept it to myself as it wouldn’t have come to fruition anyway.

Don’t tell anyone anything. Just do your work quietly behind the scenes, and when it’s ready, then tell what you did or built to as many people as you can.

This is how many producers go about their work. They work without advertising, and once they tell about their new thing, they’re already working on something new.

Yet for some people telling others creates a certain positive pressure that makes them accountable to their friends or family.

So, it’s okay to talk about and share what you’re working on. However, instead of saying: “I’m going to be this and do that,” rather say: “I’m working on this project” or something similar.

Find out what works for you, but be careful of the ego trap. Our egos like to be soothed by us telling ourselves a story of all the things we could do if we just wanted.

Sometimes people are afraid to actually do the thing they are talking about so much, because if they would fail - and they’re afraid of that - then the story would be ruined as well. This, in turn, hurts the ego.

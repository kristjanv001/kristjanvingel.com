title: How I learned Python in less than a week while it takes months for many

So, I just learned Python.

It took me a few days to pick up the syntax and build a couple of simple apps along the way.

No big deal.

So, why am I talking about this?

What people who don't know how to code (but want to learn it) mostly get wrong is that they tend to mix up a programming language with the ability to program.

There's a massive difference.

Just because someone knows the alphabet doesn't mean they can write like Shakespeare.

Anyone who knows how to code in one language can pick up the basics of another language in a week or so. Experienced engineers can read code in a language they've never seen before and mostly understand what's going on. It's quite impressive.

That's what makes learning to code in the beginning quite hard. You not only have to know the very foreign syntax, but you also have to learn the fundamental principles at the same time. So instead of learning one thing, you're learning two things.

This is why I was able to pick up Python relatively quickly. I did not have to learn the basic principles of software engineering like variables, loops, functions, control flow, etc. I already knew them. All I had to do was familiarize myself with the new (familiar-similar) syntax.

So, there's no point in stressing over the specific language. It doesn't matter.

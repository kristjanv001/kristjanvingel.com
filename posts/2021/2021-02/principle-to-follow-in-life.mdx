There are a thousand ways to achieve success in any area of life - whether it be material wealth, professional success, spiritual life, relationships, etc.

But, there is only one thing all of these people who have achieved success in their field have in common.

They did not give up.

Otherwise, we wouldn't know about them, right?

It doesn't mean that success will be guaranteed, but without it, it's impossible.

Because nobody else will. Nobody will come to save us. Nobody really cares if we make it or not.

"But Kristjan, what does it mean to take responsibility?"

It means that we are responsible for our lives. We're the CEO, whether we like it or not.

Being a CEO is hard. True. That's why many people give up - they've quit being in charge. They're out of the building. The company without a CEO is a mess, as you can imagine. There's no plan, no direction. No purpose. It's definitely not going to end very well.

Don't let it be you. Nobody's going to come and save your company.

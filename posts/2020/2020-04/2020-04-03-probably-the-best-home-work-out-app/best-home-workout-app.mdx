Gyms are closed, even the outdoor ones. This pushed me to find a way to train at home harder than the regular average Joe's few pushups and a couple of dumbbell exercises. Of course, doing some exercise is better than nothing, but I was looking for something serious.

So, I discovered an app called Centr. The man behind it is Chris Hemsworth - the actor who played Thor in the 2011 Hollywood blockbuster.

And, let me tell you, this is one of the best apps I've ever used. The exercises can be unforgiving (a good thing!), but the workouts vary each day and are interesting. Almost no equipment is required - and the exercises that do - have an alternative.

As far as I understand, the workouts are put together by the same professionals that have worked with Chris himself. In fact, it actually almost feels as if I have a training session every day with a different fitness expert. Absolutely awesome!

In addition to different video training guides for each day, you also get a meal plan and guided meditation exercises. I don't care about these, as I know what I'm doing when it comes to food, and I don't need an app for meditating. However, when it comes to workout apps - this one is the Maserati.

So, I thought to share this discovery - if it helps someone - awesome! If not, nothing lost.

As a side note: this is how marketing works at its best: create a product so good that its users promote it themselves without being told to do so and getting absolutely nothing for it.

The law of use - which is one of the laws of the Universe - states that if knowledge has been revealed to you, you have to use it. Wisdom is not meant to be hoarded.

Let's take getting fit and eating healthy as an example.

Infringing the law of use would mean that a beginner would consume hours upon hours of video content, read fitness blogs, buy and read different books on food, etc. without taking any action. It's hoarding information. And it's useless.

According to the law use, the better approach would be to consume e.g., one book or course and then take the next couple of months action without any new theory whatsoever.

What happens when you don't use what has been given to you?

The answer is quite simple and straightforward: it will eat away your soul.

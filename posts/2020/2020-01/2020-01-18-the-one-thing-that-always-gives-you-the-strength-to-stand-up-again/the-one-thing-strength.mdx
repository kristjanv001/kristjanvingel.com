Purpose.

Life is ruthless. We all know that. Sometimes it feels as if the boot of life is hitting you in the face again and again until you’re face-down in the dirt. It’s the struggle of life, and we all get to experience it from time to time.

Obviously, the important part is to get back up again and keep going - sometimes easier said than done.

What I think is the one thing that gives us the power to do that is having a strong purpose in our lives. Something that you want so much, you think about it every single day. Napoleon Hill calls it “the burning desire.”

When people without a clear goal go down, they lack the will to get back up. They give up. They say things like” what’s the point, everything’s fucked up anyway.”

It’s called apathy, and it’s everywhere if you look around.

In fact, if you look closely, you can see how many people walking around are already dead - they just don’t know it yet. You can see it in the pupils. The eyes never lie, as the saying goes.

Apathy is one of the worst emotional states to be in - way worse anger, sadness, or grief. People in apathy have given up on their goals, their dreams - their life. They exist physically but are not living.

Having a strong purpose doesn’t let that happen. It gives you the superpower to keep on going no matter how rough things get.

I encourage you to find your burning desire if you already haven’t and use it as fuel to march on. Reminding yourself of your end-goal will help you get through the rainy days a lot easier.

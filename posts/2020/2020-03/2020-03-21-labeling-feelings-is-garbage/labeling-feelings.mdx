Some books recommend labeling feelings/emotions. E.g., that it's a good idea to put a name on a negative feeling, so it'd be easier to deal with it.

Labeling doesn't do anything.

Feelings are too complex of a phenomenon to describe them with some words. But that's not even the main point. The main thing is that feelings are to be *felt* not labeled.

The whole labeling process implies that emotions can be intellectually understood, described, and then sorted into folders for reference.

There's no point in trying to find a label - the feelings can be experienced without it - I'm sure everyone agrees with it. So, feel the feeling, and don't worry about the name.

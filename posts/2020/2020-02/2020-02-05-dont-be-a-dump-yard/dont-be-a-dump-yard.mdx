If someone would dump their garbage to your yard, would you be cool with it? Probably not. In fact, it’s hard to find a person who’d be okay with it.

Yet, many people allow others to dump their trash into their minds when it comes to social media, ads, TV, radio, etc.

Why are we so protective of our material possessions, but not so much when it comes to probably the most precious thing there is - our mind.

This is why I don’t watch TV at all. I can’t choose what is shown to me. Whatever is on at that particular time, I have to watch it, and 99% of the time, the stuff that is shown on TV is absolute garbage and a waste of time.

News - either on the web, TV, or on paper are mostly negative, so for me, it’s automatically garbage. I don’t need any negativity in my life. I want to surround myself with positivity. It’s contagious. And so is negativity - that’s why you should stay away from it. That includes negative people.

Social media is pretty much the same. You think you choose the things on your feed, yet somehow so much trash comes as a” bonus.” Someone’s baby pictures, memes, music videos, or other dumb stuff.

All this influences our thinking. It does it so subtly we don’t even notice it. E.g., most people would say they’re not affected by ads shown to them - yet why do companies still show ads then?

Don’t be naive and think these things don’t affect you, because you’re special. We’re all affected. So this is why it’s best to stay away from that stuff in the first place.

The point is simple: don’t allow any random stuff to be thrown at you. Be the chooser of what you listen, watch, and read.
